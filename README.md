# NoCap-OSBMX-reverseengineered
I'm reverse engineering OSBMX 24 of this repository because I want to make some adjustments and using the STL didn't work out for me.
The Caps are based of the original NoCap repo as far as I can tell.

This branch is for increasing the button height - the head of the button will stand out a bit. This is for analog button experiments.
